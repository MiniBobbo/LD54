Ideas:
- Different Robot Types
- Robots collide
- Subroutines
- Wait Instructions
- Remove Nothing orders from instruction lists
- Jump
Next Level button on complete
Reset Level button on complete.
- Don't allow subroutines to call subroutines
Check for collisions before the teleporting which will make levels slightly harder. 

Polish:
Animations
Music
- Main Menu
Screen Transitions
Robots teleport when complete
- Starting Creation Juice
- Add Reset button to Instructions scene
- Menu on Game Screen
Add a delay between the last robot hitting the teleporter and the level ending

Bugs:
- Drag and drop disappears over icons for some reason. 
- Bots don't teleport when reaching goal and still Twitch.
Occasional solving issues.  Not sure what the problem is.

Later:
Multiple exits
Land on tile routine (fixes multiple exits and allows for things like spikes)
Board changes each step
