Bugs:
- Drag and drop disappears over icons for some reason. 
- Bots don't teleport when reaching goal and still Twitch.
- You can run and reset even after the puzzle is solved.  Causes graphical problems.  

Later:
Multiple exits
Land on tile routine (fixes multiple exits and allows for things like spikes)
Board changes each step
Check for collisions before the teleporting which will make levels slightly harder.
